## 🌳 Overview  

This project applies **computer vision** to identify wildlife species from motion-activated camera-trap images across Stone Mountain.  
- **5 camera traps** placed in different ecosystems  
- Earlier approaches using public ML models were **less accurate & slower** than manual labeling  
- Our goal: build a **region-specific training dataset** and a more **effective pipeline** for species ID

## 🛠️ Project Pipeline  

We’re currently running a **two-stage architecture**:

1️⃣ **Stage 1 – Animal Detection**  
> Classify frames as *animal* vs *empty*.  

2️⃣ **Stage 2 –TBD**
